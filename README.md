  <p>Hello.</p>
  
  <p>I'm currently working on making <b>PyQt/PySide</b> softwares and <b>Python</b> scripts.</p>
  
  <p>I've started PyQt5 in January 2021 and i've been hooked on desktop software development with Python ever since.</p>
  
  <p>I'm using PyCharm, Python 3.7, Windows 11.</p>
  
  <h5>== 2022/06/21 ==</h5>
  
  <p>I recently started Flutter. It works fine and design is great(actually it is some of the best i've ever seen). Especially unifying Desktop/Web/Mobile scheme seems to be really ambitious to me.</p>
    
  <p>I will use it when i have to make the very or semi-simple desktop-mobile responsive application or mobile-only application, even though Flutter has a performance issue with iOS and obviously it is.. new.</p>
  
  <p>Don't worry; I will keep using PyQt since it supports a lot of third party libraries, easy enough to use, performance is fine.</p>
  
  <p>In conclusion: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Desktop/Embedded app: PyQt/PySide
    <li>Desktop-mobile app: Flutter
    <li>Mobile app: Flutter
    <li>Mobile app which performance has to be fine in any platform: React Native - Maybe i won't use this.
    <li>Web app: Electron
    <li>Windows App SDK/WPF - ???
  </ul>
