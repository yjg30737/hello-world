  <p>Hello.</p>
  
  <p>I work as a <b>back-end</b> developer on weekdays.</p>
  
  <p>So, as you can guess, i am very busy on weekdays, sorry to say.</p>
  
  <p>In my spare time(weekend or holiday or etc), i'm "trying to" work on making <b>PyQt/PySide</b> softwares and <b>Python</b> scripts.</p>
  
  <p>I've started PyQt5 in January 2021 and i've been hooked on desktop software development with Python ever since.</p>
  
  <p>I'm using PyCharm, Python 3.7, Windows 11.</p>
  
  <h5>== 2022/06/21 ==</h5>
  
  <p>I recently started Flutter. It works fine and design is great(actually it is some of the best i've ever seen). Especially unifying Desktop/Web/Mobile scheme seems to be really ambitious to me.</p>
    
  <p>I will use it when i have to make the very or semi-simple desktop-mobile responsive application or mobile-only application, even though Flutter has a performance issue with iOS and obviously it is.. new.</p>
  
  <p>Don't worry; I will keep using PyQt since it supports a lot of third party libraries, easy enough to use, performance is fine.</p>
  
  <p>In conclusion: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Desktop/Embedded app: PyQt/PySide
    <li>Desktop-mobile app: Flutter
    <li>Mobile app: Flutter
    <li>Mobile app which performance has to be fine in any platform: React Native - Maybe i won't use this.
    <li>Web app: Electron
    <li>Windows App SDK/WPF - ???
  </ul>
  
  <h5>== 2022/09/04 ==</h5>
  <p>I find that <b>PySide6 can turn png icon in the button into svg icon</b> automatically, or at least make its quality better.</p>
  <p>Correct me if i'm wrong.</p>
  
  <h5>== 2022/09/09 ==</h5>
  <p>I found new one! In Windows 11, if you give svg icon to QPushButton, QPushButton shows the svg icon with good quality! not like bad quality svg icon which defeats the whole purpose to have the svg icon.</p>
  <p>Get Windows 11 right away, guys!</p>
