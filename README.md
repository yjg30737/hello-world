  <p>Hello.</p>
  
  <p>I'm currently working on making <b>PyQt5</b> softwares and <b>Python</b> scripts.</p>
  
  <p>I've started PyQt5 in January 2021 and i've been hooked on that ever since.</p>
  
  <p>I'm using PyCharm, Python 3.7, Windows 10.</p>
  
  <h3>== 2022/06/21 ==</h3>
  
  <p>I recently started Flutter. It works fine and design is great(actually it is some of the best i've ever seen). Especially unifying Desktop/Web/Mobile scheme seems to be really ambitious to me.</p>
    
  <p>I will use it when i have to make the very or semi-simple desktop-mobile responsive application or mobile-only application, even though Flutter has a performance issue with iOS and obviously it is.. new.</p>
  
  <p>Don't worry; I will keep using PyQt since it supports a lot of third party libraries, easy enough to use, performance is fine.</p>
  
  <p>In conclusion: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Desktop app: PyQt5
    <li>Desktop-mobile app: Flutter
    <li>Mobile app: Flutter
    <li>Mobile app which performance has to be fine in any platform: React Native - Maybe i won't use this.
  </ul>
  
  <h3>== 2022/06/25 ==</h3>
  
  <p>PyQt6/PySide6 has advantages that PyQt5 does not have.</p>
  
  <p>PyQt6/PySide6 do high DPI supporting by default unlike PyQt5.</p>
  
  <p>For PySide6 only, other advantage is that they "somewhat" seems to have solved this bug <a href="https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-55401">here.</a></p>
  
  <p>But i can't use the PySide6 simply by those reasons. There are many 3rd party libraries which has only compatible with qt5 or below.</p>
  
  <p>Also, higher version doesn't mean it would be good.</p> 
    
  <p>Anyways, my 2 days research to try to solve the bug above is over and i cannot find any solution to solve it. I guess i should live with it...</p>
