  <p>Hello.</p>
  
  <p>I'm currently working on making <b>PyQt5</b> softwares and <b>Python</b> scripts.</p>
  
  <p>I don't use PyQt6 because of compatibility issue.</p> 
  
  <p>I've started PyQt5 in January 2021 and i've been hooked on that ever since.</p>
  
  <p>I'm working on very easy peasy pyqt5 based gui widget toolkits.</p>
  
  <p>Python is easy as breathing and one of the most famous language in the world so this will turn out good.</p>
  
  <p>I will start Youtube channel in the near future.</p> 
  
  <p>I'm using PyCharm, Python 3.7, Windows 10.</p>
