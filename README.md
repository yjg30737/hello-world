  <p>Hello.</p>
  
  <p>I'm currently working on making <b>PyQt5</b> softwares and <b>Python</b> scripts.</p>
  
  <p>I've started PyQt5 in January 2021 and i've been hooked on that ever since.</p>
  
  <p>I'm using <b>PyCharm</b>.
    
  <p>When i code PyQt5 scripts i camel-cased directly pyqt5-related code only such as QLabel.</p>
 
  <p>If variable is not directly related to PyQt5 such as int, str type variable i won't do it.</p> 
  
  <p>This is little snippet of information about me to let you know that i try not to be arbitrary.</p>
  
  <p>Yeah, that is so confusing. oh well.</p>
